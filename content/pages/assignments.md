Homework 1

a) Do all required reading for Lecture 1 and Lecture 2

b) Write a paragraph of feedback on the framing documents. A suggested format is the "plus-delta" format used for constructive critiques in industry: Note a few of the best points of the document (from any perspective, e.g. new knowledge, clear explanations, useful tools, etc.), then a few things you would change, and how; e.g. things you had trouble understanding (muddy points), boring or confusing prose, poor organization, things that did not appear useful. The intent is to critique the documents themselves, but on weeks that the documents themselves are short and cite papers and web sites for information, feel free to extend the critique to the broader learning experience

c) Find a description of one space system architecture (DSP, Apollo, NMD etc) and create representations of each of the following four different views of the architecture: physical, functional, information flow, and organizational

Homework 2

a) Do all required reading for Lecture 3

b) Write a paragraph of feedback on the framing document (use the Plus/Delta format from Homework 1)

c) Map out the SMAD process and discuss it in light of the Young report. Identify and analyze the key success and failure factors in the process. 2-3 pages

Homework 3

a) Do all required reading

b) Create a simple tradespace analysis of a problem you are familiar with. It can be a personal decision (see "MATEing;" car and house buying are also examples that SSPARC people have analyzed) or a technical problem that is not too complex to analyze

1) Bound and Scope the problem   
2) Create a list of attributes, and draw single attribute utility curves for them   
3) Create a design vector   
4) Model the relation between the design vector and the attributes   
5) Evaluate the relationship for a range of designs, and use the utility curves to find the single attribute utilities for the designs. You may wish to use a weighted sum to find a multi-attribute utility   
6) Present the results graphically in any way that makes sense. Classic is the multi-attribute utility vs. cost, but your problem may not have a cash cost, or may have only a few attributes, presenting other possibilities   
7) Discuss the results. What implications do they have for the handling of the problem that you proposed to study?

Keep it simple – the point is to complete a tradespace exercise. Try to find a problem with only a few attributes and design variables, and keep the modeled relationship as simple as possible. Please explain simplifications, but do not feel you have to extensively justify them

Uncertainty and Risk

Homework 9

a) Do all required reading

b) Write a paragraph of feedback on the framing document

c) The DSB report points out that risk (the downside of uncertainty) is the implicit variable when performance, cost and schedule are constrained on state of the art space systems. Undertake a historical review of how risk has been mitigated (or not) in the human space program. What lessons can be learned from the success of Apollo and the relative failure of the STS program. Analyze the relationship between technical, organizational and cultural risk. You might find the Columbia Accident Investigation report helpful

Flexibility for Space Systems I

Homework 10

a) Do all required reading

b) Write a paragraph of feedback on the framing document

c) Compare and contrast the different definitions of flexibility. In particular, the ESD definition is much more related to the ideas of a network. Now apply these ideas to the conceptual definition of a hundred year old space system. What aspects would have to be designed into it so that it operates and can communicate after a century?
